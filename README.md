# 3DS Gemini Client

This is a client I made for last year's ROOPHLOCH so I could create a post. It's pretty barebones, and I was under a time crunch to complete it so it's a little messy. Super proud of it though, took way too long to get the TLS working.
It has page rendering, text input, and link redirection.
Moving the repository here for portfolio purposes.
